# Food-Delivery-App-DesignThinking
<h4>Overview</h4><br>
This repository contains the documentation and resources related to our design thinking approach for improving the user experience of our food delivery app. We follow a structured design thinking process to create a user-centered, innovative solution to address the challenges faced by our users.<br>

<h4>Project Goals</h4><br>
1.Enhance the user experience by addressing pain points and user needs.<br>
2.Create an app that is intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use.<br>
3.Innovate and differentiate ourselves in the competitive food delivery market.<br>

<h4>Design Thinking Process</h4><br>
Our project follows the traditional design thinking process, including the following key phases:<br>
<h1>Empathize:</h1> In this phase, we aim to understand the needs, preferences, and pain points of our users. We conduct user research, interviews, and observations to empathize with our target audience.<br>
<h1>Define:</h1> We define a clear problem statement based on our findings from the Empathize phase. This helps us focus our efforts on solving the most critical issues.<br>
<h1>Ideate:</h1> During this phase, we brainstorm creative ideas and potential solutions to address the defined problem. Our diverse team collaborates to explore new possibilities.<br>
<h1>Prototype:</h1> We create low-fidelity prototypes and mock-ups to visualize our design concepts. These prototypes allow us to test and refine our ideas before development.<br>
<h1>Test:</h1> We gather feedback through user testing and iterate on our design based on the insights gained. This helps us refine our solutions to meet user expectations.<br>

<h4>Tools and Resources</h4><br>
<h1>Figma:</h1> Used for creating and testing prototypes.<br>
<h1>User Interview Guide:</h1> A document detailing questions and techniques for user interviews.<br>
<h1>User Personas:</h1> Descriptions of our target users to guide our design process.<br>
